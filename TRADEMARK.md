# Diffracta Trademark Policy

“Diffracta” is a trademark owned by the original author of the
Diffracta project. The software is released as free and open
source, but the name, logo, and associated branding ("the Marks")
are protected by trademark law. This policy ensures that the
Diffracta name remains consistent, trusted, and associated only
with the official project.

## 1. Trademark Ownership

The name “Diffracta,” the Diffracta logo, and any related marks
are trademarks owned exclusively by the Diffracta project’s
creator. The GPL-3.0-or-later software license does *not*
transfer or grant trademark rights.

## 2. Permitted Uses

The following uses of the Marks are allowed without explicit
permission, provided they are truthful and non-misleading:

- Referring to the official Diffracta software in an accurate,
  descriptive, and non-confusing manner (nominative fair use).
- Distributing unmodified copies of the official Diffracta source
  code or binaries.
- Educational uses such as tutorials, documentation, reviews, or
  videos, so long as they clearly do **not** imply endorsement.

These uses must not:
- Suggest sponsorship or affiliation.
- Modify the Marks.

## 3. Restricted Uses (Permission Required)

You must obtain explicit written permission to:

- Use the Diffracta name or logo in any commercial product,
  service, or derivative work.
- Use the Marks in marketing, advertising, or branding materials.
- Incorporate the Marks into your own product names or logos.
- Represent your project, fork, or company as being associated
  with, partnered with, or endorsed by Diffracta.

protected by trademark law. They may not be:

- Modified,
- Reused in derivative products,
- Used on websites or products for marketing purposes,
- Incorporated into new logos or visual identities.

Descriptive or comparative references (e.g. “Based on Diffracta”)
